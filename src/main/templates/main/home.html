                  <p class="lead">
                    Marble, granite, travertine, slate, limestone and onyx are natural stones that are excavated from the earth in large blocks. Afterwards, these blocks are cut into large slabs or tiles. Natural stones are available in a wonderful variety of colors and patterns.
                  </br></br>The beauty of natural stone is its timeless elegance that has been used throughout history. From the 8th century B.C. on the Egyptian pyramids, to the 6th century A.D. Vatican in Rome, to the 20th century A.D.
                  Today, architects, engineers and designers are still using natural stones to beautify their surroundings, not only for its luxurious appearance but also for the many advantages that natural stone possesses.
